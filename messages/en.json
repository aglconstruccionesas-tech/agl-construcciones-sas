Before beginning any work, we carry out a comprehensive technical analysis to determine the most appropriate strategy based on the characteristics of the structure, the surrounding environment, and the client’s specific requirements.\n\nTo execute the work, we rely on specialized machinery and apply controlled demolition techniques, which help minimize the impact on neighboring areas while ensuring the safe progress of the project. At the same time, we manage all waste in compliance with current environmental regulations, keeping the site clean, orderly, and risk-free.\n\nOur team of experts ensures that the land is fully cleared and prepared for the next stage of the project, such as foundations or new construction.
